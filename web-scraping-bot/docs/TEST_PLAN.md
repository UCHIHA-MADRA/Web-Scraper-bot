# Web Scraping Bot Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Web Scraping Bot project. It defines the testing approach, test types, test environments, and test coverage requirements to ensure the application functions correctly and reliably.

## Testing Objectives

- Verify that all components of the Web Scraping Bot function as expected
- Ensure the application handles errors gracefully
- Validate that the caching system works efficiently
- Confirm that data extraction and processing are accurate
- Test the security features of the application
- Verify email reporting functionality

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests verify individual components in isolation. Current coverage includes:

- Cache functionality (`test_cache.py`)
- Logger functionality (`test_logger.py`)
- Authentication system (`test_auth.py`)
- Security features (`test_security.py`)
- Basic scraper functionality (`test_scraper.py`, `test_scraper_pytest.py`)

**Additional unit tests needed:**

- Report generation functionality
- Email sending functionality
- Data processing and transformation
- CLI interface

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly.

**Integration tests needed:**

- Scraper to cache integration
- Scraper to report generator integration
- Report generator to email sender integration
- Authentication to web interface integration

### 3. End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests verify complete workflows from start to finish.

**E2E tests needed:**

- Complete scraping workflow (configuration → scraping → processing → reporting → email)
- Web interface workflow (login → view reports → configure scraping → logout)

### 4. Performance Tests

Performance tests verify the application's efficiency and resource usage.

**Performance tests needed:**

- Cache hit/miss ratio analysis
- Scraping speed with different target configurations
- Memory usage during large scraping operations

## Test Environment

### Local Development Environment

- Python 3.8+
- pytest and pytest-cov for test execution and coverage reporting
- Mock external services (websites, email servers)

### CI/CD Environment

- GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD platform
- Automated test execution on pull requests
- Coverage reporting and enforcement

## Test Coverage Requirements

- Minimum code coverage: 80%
- All critical paths must be tested
- All error handling code must be tested
- All public APIs must have tests

## Test Data Management

- Use fixture data for predictable test execution
- Create mock responses for external services
- Use parameterized tests for testing multiple scenarios

## Test Execution Strategy

### Local Development

- Run unit tests during development with `python run_tests.py`
- Run specific test modules with `python run_tests.py -t tests/test_module.py`
- Generate coverage reports with `python run_tests.py` (default behavior)

### Continuous Integration

- Run all tests on every pull request
- Block merging if tests fail or coverage drops below threshold
- Generate and publish coverage reports

## Test Reporting

- Use pytest's built-in reporting
- Generate HTML coverage reports
- Track test metrics over time (pass rate, coverage)

## Responsibilities

- Developers: Write and maintain unit tests for their code
- QA: Write integration and end-to-end tests
- All: Review test results and address failures

## Schedule

- Unit tests: Ongoing with development
- Integration tests: After unit test framework is complete
- End-to-end tests: After integration test framework is complete
- Performance tests: Before production release

## Risks and Mitigations

- External website changes: Use robust selectors and error handling
- Rate limiting: Implement retry logic and respect robots.txt
- Network issues: Test with simulated network failures
- Data format changes: Use schema validation
